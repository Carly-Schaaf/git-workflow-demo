~~~ GITHUB WORKFLOW ~~~
1. Do your work on feature branches.
2. Regularly merge master into feature branch if master is being updated (at the very least, do this before submitting your pull request and before merging in your feature branch).
3. When feature is complete, submit a Pull Request and assign it to a team member to review your code.
Discuss code, make any necessary changes. When assigned team member approves the pull request, merge the feature branch into master.
